# Citizen Spring Pages

Create a quick website for your citizen initiative that anyone in your community can edit using Google Docs.

## Why?

I'm involved in many different collectives / citizen initiatives / communities and I often ran into the issue of "how can I quickly create a website that anyone in the community can edit without having to learn yet another platform?".

Turns out, the easiest tool for everone to use is Google Docs.
So I built a small engine to publish Google Docs in a nicer way.

## Features

**Allow anyone to make suggestions**
Google Doc allows you to give everyone's permission to make edit suggestions. This is a great way to enable anyone in the community to update the website and add new information. People with editing permission can approve the changes and voil√†, your website is updated!

**Mobile friendly**

**Image optimization**
All images are automatically optimized for mobile or desktop.

**Embeds**
Automatically embed YouTube, Vimeo and Loom videos, and tweets (just add the full URL in a new line)

**Custom domains**
